Welcome! I'm Danny Krolikowski, a 5th year PhD student in Astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin.

My broad research interests involve young stars and their planetary systems: to understand how they form and evolve in their early lifetimes, which is the period of most dynamic evolution that sets the stage for their fates and potential habitability. In particular, I have studied nearby young stellar associations to determine the structure of their formation, and how they will evolve and dissolve over time. I also have started a program to search for planets in young stellar systems to map the typical system architecture at young ages, and where possible constrain the masses and compositions of these quickly evolving young planets.

See my [research](/research) page for more on the research I have been doing at UT, and my [teaching](/teach) page to read about some of the teaching and outreach I have done since my undergrad days. I also am indeed a person outside of astronomy, and you can take a look at my [about me](\aboutme) page for a bit more about me.
