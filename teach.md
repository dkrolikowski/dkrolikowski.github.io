Teaching has always been my true passion in academia. Since middle school, I have enjoyed helping others learn and figuring out the best ways to explain particular concepts or material. Teaching is one of the best ways to give back in academia, and it is a joy to see others become interested in the work that we do as astronomers.

## Teaching at UT

I have been lucky to twice be the teaching assistant for the **Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence** course at UT taught by [Dr. Caroline Morley](https://carolinemorley.com) (in the Spring of 2019 and 2020).

This class is one of my favorite courses I have ever been involved in -- as a student or an instructor! In the course, we establish a background knowledge of life as we know it here on Earth, including: the biology and chemistry of life, the geologic record of life, and the effects of the host star and planet on the development of life. We then explore the rest of the galaxy for its potential habitability and methods through which we would detect life: first through a tour of the solar system, and then by introducing the wide variety of exoplanets that have been discovered to date. Finally, we have in depth conversations about intelligent life, the likelihood of its existence, how we might detect it, and whether or not we would want to give them a call.

I was fortunately given the opportunity to design lessons for 3 class periods during these two semesters of TAing.
  >The first two lessons I designed covered the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, discussing their properties and potential habitability, and mission concepts to send to these systems to search for life in them.
  >The third lesson I designed was on SETI (the search for extraterristrial intelligence), covering its history, goals, methods, and discussing whether or not we would actually want to communicate with an alien civilization (and what to do if we did!).

Something about what I did in the class, how it was set up, what the topics were.

Links to specifics that I did -- lectures and lecture tutorial activities. Maybe some testimonials? lol I dunno...

## Teaching at SUNY Geneseo

Privileges of being at an undergraduate only institution -- I got to teach a bunch! Lab TAing and then also physics learning center.
