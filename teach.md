Teaching has always been my true passion in academia. Since middle school, I have enjoyed helping others learn and figuring out the best ways to explain particular concepts or material. Teaching is one of the best ways to give back in academia, and it is a joy to see others become interested in the work that we do as astronomers.

## Teaching at UT

I have been lucky to twice be the teaching assistant for the **Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence** course at UT taught by [Dr. Caroline Morley](https://carolinemorley.com) (in the Spring of 2019 and 2020). This class is one of my favorite courses I have ever been involved in -- as a student or an instructor! Perhaps the best aspect of this course is the setup: it was taught in an interactive classroom, where the students sat at tables of about 6 people. With this setup, it is easy to couple lectures with activities, and it was particularly great at sparking conversations amongst the students.

In the course, we establish a background knowledge of life as we know it here on Earth, including: the biology and chemistry of life, the geologic record of life, and the effects of the host star and planet on the development of life. We then explore the rest of the galaxy for its potential habitability and methods through which we would detect life: first through a tour of the solar system, and then by introducing the wide variety of exoplanets that have been discovered to date. Finally, we have in depth conversations about intelligent life, the likelihood of its existence, how we might detect it, and whether or not we would want to give them a call.

I was given the opportunity to design lessons for 3 class periods during these two semesters of TAing:
  + The first two lessons I designed covered the moons of Jupiter and Saturn: to discuss their properties, how they might be habitable, and what missions we might send to learn more about the systems and detect potential biospheres. With the setup of the course, I wrote lectures and made an activity for each lesson.
    + In the first lesson, we covered the moons of Jupiter, discussing tidal heating and focusing mostly on Europa. The activity I made was to help the students connect the conditions of the Jovian moons to previously discussed topics about Earth and the development and requirements of life. You can find the activity [here](/assets/pubs/jovianmoons_activity.pdf) and the lecture [here](/assets/pubs/jovianmoons_lecture).
    + In the second lesson, we covered the moons of Saturn, focusing primarily on Enceladus (and how it compares to Europa) and Titan (how unique of a body it is and what it would mean for life to form there). The activity for this day ties together all of the information learned about the Jovian moons and their potential habitability, and teaches the students about 6 mission concepts to Jupiter or Saturn to learn about the moons and/or search for life. With the unique setup of the classroom, each table discussed the various missions and was tasked with selecting which mission to fund. This activity is found [here](/assets/pubs/jovianmissions_activity.pdf) and the lecture [here](/assets/pubs/jovianmissions_lecture).

  + The third lesson I designed was on SETI (the search for extraterrestrial intelligence), covering its history, goals, methods, and discussing whether or not we would actually want to communicate with an alien civilization (and what to do if we did!). I designed an activity for the students to "decode" the Arecibo message, which is an actual signal we have beamed into space, to highlight the difficulties in communicating with an alien species. The activity is found [here](/assets/pubs/setimessage_activity.pdf) and the lecture [here](/assets/pubs/seti_lecture.pdf).

Something about what I did in the class, how it was set up, what the topics were.

Links to specifics that I did -- lectures and lecture tutorial activities. Maybe some testimonials? lol I dunno...

## Teaching at SUNY Geneseo

Privileges of being at an undergraduate only institution -- I got to teach a bunch! Lab TAing and then also physics learning center.

## Outreach

### Astronomy on Tap

### Other?
