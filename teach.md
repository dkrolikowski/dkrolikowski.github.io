Teaching has always been my true passion in academia. Since middle school, I have enjoyed helping others learn and figuring out the best ways to explain particular concepts or material. Teaching is one of the best ways to give back in academia, and it is a joy to see others become interested in the work that we do as astronomers.

## Teaching at UT

I have been lucky to twice be the teaching assistant for the **Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence** course at UT taught by [Dr. Caroline Morley](https://carolinemorley.com) (in the Spring of 2019 and 2020).

Something about what I did in the class, how it was set up, what the topics were.

Links to specifics that I did -- lectures and lecture tutorial activities. Maybe some testimonials? lol I dunno...

## Teaching at SUNY Geneseo

Privileges of being at an undergraduate only institution -- I got to teach a bunch! Lab TAing and then also physics learning center.

## Outreach
