I was born and raised on Long Island, New York, before moving to Western NY for college and then on to Austin for grad school. When I can manage to get away from my computer, which I will say has been increasingly difficult this past year, I enjoy live music, playing video games, being on or near the water, and watching terribly bad movies (I will never not plug the funniest podcast in existence: [How Did This Get Made?](https://www.hdtgminfo.com)).

Fortunately, I moved to a city with an awesome and varied live music scene, but unfortunately I haven't gotten around to playing music again since moving for grad school. I am a percussionist, playing everything from jazz drum set to orchestral triangle. I was lucky to meet some other awesome musicians in college whose band I joined halfway through my undergrad years -- check us out if you want to hear some funky tunes: [The Red Kettle Collective](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3OKo8dOMzkCjzckYJ7eHxQ?si=JnHaAVMbRISm26R7I59sSA) :sunglasses:
