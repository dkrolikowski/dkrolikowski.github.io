{% include mathjs %}

My research interests broadly include young stars and the planets around them. This covers scales from entire regions of young or forming stars, down to the individual planets in these systems. I'm in my 5th year as a Ph.D. student at UT Austin where I work with Adam Kraus. During my undergraduate education at SUNY Geneseo, I worked with Aaron Steinhauer studying the lithium abundances of star clusters, to map the chemical evolution of lithium across time and stellar type.

## Young stellar populations

To understand how planetary systems form and evolve, we must understand how the stars they orbit do the same. One pillar of my research is the study of young stars, and in particular the groups they form in. Most stars form in clusters, or at the very least loose associations. By studying an ensemble of stars that formed together, it is easier to determine the age, and thus other stellar properties, of all stars in the group. With a well defined census, we can look at the spatial and velocity distributions of the stars in these groups to back out a picture of how they formed, which can constrain the theories and physics of star formation in general.

## Taurus

The bulk of the work I have done so far on young stars has been in the Taurus star forming region, which is the canonical region of low mass star formation in the Milky Way, and one of the nearest sites of ongoing star formation to us. Because it is so close, Taurus has been studied for a long time, leading to a rich history of knowledge of the region (my current record for oldest reference used is 1890). However, as with anything studied for so long (or let's be real, anything in astronomy), there are peculiarities that elude total explanation in the region.

For example, Taurus has a rich census of disk-bearing, young objects near the clouds featuring ongoing star formation, but it also has disk-bearing objects at wide separations from those clouds. Additionally, there are disk-free objects distributed throughout the Taurus region, which might be the result of an older epoch of star formation. The gas in Taurus is also highly structure, featuring filaments and overdensities of gas. The formation of these gas structures is intimately tied to the role of gravity and turbulence (and magnetic fields, ...) in the star formation process. Tying the gas structure to the substructure distribution of stars in the region would elucidate the process by which stars decouple from their parent cloud and evolve after formation. All of this together implies that the star formation history of Taurus is quite complicated, and unraveling its mysteries is key to our understanding of low mass star formation.

I have undertaken a couple of different projects to help answer these questions about the Taurus region, in particular looking to leverage the high precision astrometry from the *Gaia* mission to: 1) disentangle the complicated 6 dimensional (position and velocity) substructure of the Taurus stellar population and 2) search for new members of the Taurus region, especially older objects that may have eluded previous biased surveys of the region.

### Kernel-phase interferometry for imaging beyond the diffraction limit

I currently work with Adam Kraus at the University of Texas at Austin applying interferometric analysis techniques to archival data to detect close in companions, binary stars or exoplanets. This technique models the full aperture of the telescope as an array of sub-apertures. This model is then used to analyze images in the Fourier domain by simulating a redundant interferometer. The figures below show the aperture model, and the progression from  images, to Fourier amplitude and phase, to kernel-phase, and finally to fitted astrometry and photometry.
This target demonstrates the power of kernel-phase analysis by detecting a binary at $$ \sim90 $$ miliarcseconds, just over $$ 0.5\,\lambda/D $$ for *HST*, at a contrast of $$ \sim8\!:\!1\! $$. I am PI of cycle 24 Hubble Space Telescope Archival Research Grant number 14561 to support this work.

### Analysis of ALMA observations of a protoplanetary disk

My Master's research, at Wesleyan University with Professor A. Meredith Hughes, looked at the initial conditions of planet formation inside disks of gas and dust around young stars. Specifically, I analyzed radio interferometric observations of gas line emission from a protoplanetary disk in the Orion Nebula Cluster. These observations were part of an Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) cycle 0 program ([P.I. Rita Mann](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...784...82M)).

I used a simple model of the gas emission to fit the density and temperature structure of the disk. Using this information, we can compare this disk to the theoretical disk which our own solar system formed from and investigate the likelihood of planet formation. We can also compare this disk, located in a high mass star forming region (SFR), to previously studied disks in nearby low mass SFR's, to investigate the effect of the surrounding environment. I wrote my Masterâ€™s thesis on this work and it was published in the Astronomical Journal ([Factor et al. 2017](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153..233F)).

A few of the interesting results are as follows. We serendipitously discovered high-velocity asymmetric emission consistent with a 1.8-8 M$$ _\mathrm{Jupiter} $$ clump of gas orbiting at $$ 60 \pm 20 $$au. This clump is indicated by the arrow in the position-velocity diagram above, showing the velocity of gas as a function of position offset from the central star along disk major axis. Since we can resolve both the position and velocity of the gas, we were able to fit Keplerian orbits to measure the mass of the central star. We measured it to be $$ 2.17 \pm 0.07 \mathrm{M}_\odot $$, inconsistent with the previously determined spectral type of K5.  

# Undergraduate physics work at Wesleyan:

### Parity-Time symmetric systems

As an undergraduate at Wesleyan University, I worked with Professor Fred Ellis on modeling novel optical systems using simple electronics. I focused specifically on systems exhibiting parity time (PT) symmetry. PT-symmetric systems are not symmetric under parity $$ (x \rightarrow -x) $$ or time $$ (t \rightarrow -t) $$ reflection individually but are symmetric under a combined parity and time reflection. A simple example of this is a coupled oscillator system with balanced gain and loss. Under time reversal gain turns into loss and visa versa. Thus a combined parity and time reflection returns the system to its original state. We demonstrated a wide variety of interesting applications of these systems including asymmetric transport and unidirectional lasing.
