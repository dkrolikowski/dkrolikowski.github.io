My research interests and projects broadly include young stars and planets, in particular:
  + Leveraging Gaia to understand young stellar populations and their star forming history. (See my paper about the Taurus star forming region [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..110K/abstract))
  + Young stellar activity, including as a probe of stellar astrophysics and its effect on RV observations. (See my paper about the NIR Helium triplet's activity [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04971))
  + The architecture of young planetary systems and their formation pathways
  + Spectroscopic data reduction and analysis

Below I talk in more detail about some of the main projects I have worked on.

# The Taurus star forming region's substructure and history

Gaia has provided an unprecedented level of high quality astrometry and photometry across the entire sky. With its high precision, we can use Gaia data to map the 3D (and including radial velocities 6D) structure of stellar populations which can back out a picture of how they formed and constrain the theories of star formation, such as the role of different triggers of star formation or the dispersal mechanisms of stellar groups.

In work I presented as the first chapter in my dissertation, I compiled the most comprehensive census of the Taurus star forming region's stellar population to date, and used Gaia to map its structure and uncover its star forming history. Taurus is the canonical region of low mass star formation, but it has a complex history with multiple populations that are still not yet fully understood. In this work, we found significant spatial substructure in Taurus's stellar population, with two types of subgroups: those tightly confined in space (and preferentially near the clouds) and those that are distributed throughout the region. Check out a cool interactive plot [here](/taurus) showing the Taurus stellar population and our identified subgroups in galactic 3D space. The plot to the right shows the Taurus stellar population in the galactic XY plane, with different markers indicating different stellar groups.

The region as a whole is fairly coherent in kinematics, although there are some hints of kinematic substructure that correlate with spatial position. On average, the tightly confined groups are younger than the distributed groups, which makes sense as they are nearer to the areas of ongoing star formation. In all, this points to a highly complicated star formation history of Taurus, having at least two successive epochs of star formation featuring multiple modes (clustered and distributed) of star formation simultaneously. This work is published in The Astronomical Journal, and you read more about the methods and conclusions [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..110K/abstract).

# Stellar activity in the NIR Helium triplet at young ages

Over the last 5 years, the NIR Helium triplet absorption feature (~10830 angstrom) has emerged as an extremely important probe to detect exoplanet exospheres and atmospheric mass loss. The commissioning of multiple NIR precision spectrometers (such as HPF) have made it easier to observe the NIR Helium triplet and observe *samples* of planets to search for exospheres and measure mass loss across planetary and stellar properties, which will help elucidate the cause and timescale of atmospheric mass loss. To understand the timescale it is necessary to look for exospheres as a function of age, particularly at young ages.

*However*, the NIR Helium triplet, which is a chromospheric line, is sensitive to stellar activity. Since activity is higher at younger ages, potential contamination of exosphere observations from the host star activity itself is a greater issue for young exoplanets. The activity-driven behavior of the NIR Helium triplet at young ages is not well-studied though.

[![Helium Variability vs Age](/assets/img/he_var_vs_age.pdf){: width="40%" align="left" style="padding:10px"}](/assets/img/he_var_vs_age.pdf)

In recently published work, I used a large set of HPF data of a sample of young exoplanet host stars to analyze the NIR Helium triplet absorption as a function of age, activity, and time. We find that the NIR Helium triplet is indeed variable from stellar activity, with increased variability at younger ages and the fastest rotation periods. The plot to the left shows the intrinsic stellar Helium triplet absorption variability vs. age, highlighting a precipitous decrease from high variability at the youngest ages. We also use the absorption strength to study the structure of young chromospheres and reinforce previously published conclusions that the NIR Helium transition in active chromospheres is driven by collisional excitation, implying that these active chromospheres are denser than older, quieter counterparts. Stellar activity can definitely affect and confuse exosphere observations, although for stars with ages above 200-300 Myr it shouldn't totally prevent the detection of exospheres. 

**The main takeaway is just to be careful** -- while stellar activity isn't a death knell for finding young exospheres, we just need to carefully considering transit timing, other activity indicators, etc. when interpreting exosphere observations.

# Newly formed and evolving planetary systems

Planets are at their most dynamic in the first billion years of their lifetime, when the bulk of atmospheric and orbital evolution occurs. Observing the properties of planets across this timeframe is crucial in constraining competing models of planet formation and evolution, which make contrasting predictions for the distributions of such properties over time. For example, different orbital migration mechanisms result in different planet occurrence as a function of age, and different causes of atmospheric sculpting predict different planetary mass loss rates and radii distributions. Dozens of young planets have been discovered by missions such as K2 and TESS, including in young clusters and associations or around young field stars. Precisely characterizing the properties of these planets (mass, bulk density, atmospheric composition) and their systems (i.e. other planets in the system and their orbital properties) will greatly increase our understanding of the early evolution of planetary systems.

## Probing the architectures of young planetary systems

![Starspots](/assets/img/starspot.gif){: width="300" align="right"}

Young stars are active, leading to a high level of photometric and spectroscopic variability that make discovering and characterizing planets around them quite difficult. For example, the presence of starspots introduces radial velocity jitter, which is temporally coherent noise that inflates the scatter of RV measurements of a star. This makes it extremely difficult to measure the mass of young planets, particularly those with small masses. One way to mitigate this issue is to observe in the infrared, where starspot contrast is decreased and RV jitter is smaller. The Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph, a precision near-infrared spectrograph on the 10-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope at McDonald Observatory, is an ideal instrument to precisely measure the RVs of young stars and try to detect the doppler signal of planets around them.

I have started a survey of young transiting planet hosts found by K2 and TESS with HPF to search for the RV signals of non-transiting planets in the systems, particularly giant planets exterior to the transiting planets. Compact, multi-planet systems found by Kepler have an over-occurrence of outer gas giants compared to the field. This should be true at young ages as well, although any differences might indicate the role that planet-planet scattering plays in orbital migration or how common it is for outer planets to be ejected from a planetary system (such as if the occurrence is *even higher* for younger systems). We are observing all young transiting planet hosts that are observable by the HET (norther hemisphere), and have at least a year-long baseline for all targets; the time baseline is the constraining factor in detecting outer gas giants comparable to those in the compact Kepler systems.

## Searching for new young stellar groups

Like I said above, Gaia provides an unprecedented look into stellar populations. This doesn't just apply to groups of stars already established in the literature. The precision astrometry can be used to look for groups of stars not previously known by finding stars with similar 3D positions and on-sky motions. However, many stars in Gaia are missing radial velocity (particularly to sub-km/s precision) and there is no youth indicator information beyond Gaia photometry-based isochronal ages.

Those last two pieces of info can be added with high resolution spectroscopy, to measure radial velocities and traditional spectroscopic youth indicators like H-alpha and lithium abundance. I have done significant observing using the Tull coud√© optical echelle spectrograph at McDonald Observatory to look at candidate members of young stellar groups, both known and unknown. For example, I have looked for new members of the distributed/older population of Taurus and also looked for the host stellar populations of young transiting planet host stars found with K2 and TESS. A poster with preliminary results from my survey for new Taurus members can be found [here](/assets/pubs/poster_coolstars20.pdf).

As a part of this effort, I wrote a pipeline for the Tull spectrograph to reduce its data and perform simple analysis, including measuring radial velocities and Li equivalent widths. I write more about this pipeline on my [Software page](/software).

## Lithium abundances in star clusters across time

As an undergrad at SUNY Geneseo, I worked with [Dr. Aaron Steinhauer](https://www.geneseo.edu/steinhauer) on a variety of projects studying the lithium abundances of open and globular star clusters. Lithium is a sensitive and important tracer of chemical evolution in stars, where it can be produced and destroyed easily. Lithium depletes over time because it burns at relatively low temperatures, which makes it a fairly robust youth indicator. Lithium can also be created in the interiors of stars, although it often is immediately destroyed again. However, there are non-standard processes that could bring fresh Li to the stellar surface, which can then be observed and used to test models of the stellar interior. I worked on projects to map the Li abundances of both main sequence and red giant stars in multiple clusters, including open and globular clusters.
