My research interests broadly include young stars, the stellar populations in which they reside, and the planets around them. This includes projects that cover scales from entire regions of young or forming stars, down to the individual planets in these systems. I'm in my 5th year as a Ph.D. student at [UT Austin](https://astronomy.utexas.edu) where I work with Adam Kraus. During my undergraduate education at [SUNY Geneseo](https://www.geneseo.edu/physics), I worked with Aaron Steinhauer studying the lithium abundances of star clusters, to map the chemical evolution of lithium across time and stellar type.

# Young stellar populations

To understand how planetary systems form and evolve, we must understand how the stars they orbit do the same. One pillar of my research is the study of young stars, and in particular the groups they form in. Most stars form in clusters, or at the very least loose associations. By studying an ensemble of stars that formed together, it is easier to determine the age, and thus other stellar properties, of all stars in the group. With a well defined census, we can look at the spatial and velocity distributions of the stars in these groups to back out a picture of how they formed, which can constrain the theories and physics of star formation in general.

## Taurus

The bulk of the work I have done so far on young stars has been in the Taurus star forming region, which is the canonical region of low mass star formation in the Milky Way, and one of the nearest sites of ongoing star formation to us. Because it is so close, Taurus has been studied for a long time, leading to a rich history of knowledge of the region (my current record for oldest reference used is 1890). However, as with anything studied for so long, or really anything in astronomy, there are peculiarities in the greater Taurus region that elude total explanation.

For example, Taurus has a rich census of disk-bearing, young objects near the clouds featuring ongoing star formation, but it also has disk-bearing objects at wide separations from those clouds. Additionally, there are disk-free objects distributed throughout the Taurus region, which might be the result of an older epoch of star formation. The gas in Taurus is also highly structured, featuring filaments and overdensities of gas (see the image to the right from [Goldsmith et al. 2008](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...680..428G/abstract)). The formation of these gas structures is intimately tied to the role of gravity and turbulence (and magnetic fields, ...) in the star formation process. Tying the gas structure to the substructure distribution of stars in the region would elucidate the process by which stars decouple from their parent cloud and evolve after formation. All of this together implies that the star formation history of Taurus is quite complicated, and unraveling its mysteries is key to our understanding of low mass star formation.

I have undertaken a couple of different projects to help answer these questions about the Taurus region, in particular looking to leverage the high precision astrometry from the *Gaia* mission to: 1) disentangle the complicated 6D position and velocity substructure of the Taurus stellar population and 2) search for new members of the Taurus region, especially older objects that may have eluded previous biased surveys of the region.

### Substructure in the Taurus region using *Gaia* EDR3

The main project involving Taurus I have worked on is using *Gaia* EDR3 to investigate the substructure in the region, and paint a picture of the star forming history of the region. Using an expansive census of objects that have been previously considered members of the greater Taurus region. Sentence about the substructure in space. Sentence about what it looks like in velocity. Sentence about ages, and also the age gradient. Conclusions! And then also a link to the interactive plot and also the paper.
